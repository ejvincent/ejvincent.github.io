Static and dynamic stretching.

Leg exercises:

> In order to solve this issue, I’d need to incorporate unilateral bodyweight movements, focusing on waking up my ‘dead’ glutes, engaging my hamstrings properly and making sure that, as I did any form of squat or bent-knee exercise, my kneecap track outwardly properly. (This means that, as I would lower into a squat, my kneecap would move outward, roughly parallel to the 3rd toe of the corresponding foot.)

Hip stretch/exercise:

> I also incorporated a series of hip movements that I stole from a fantastic Tim Ferriss book, called the Reverse Jane Fonda.

Above wasn't enough. Needed regular glute activation:

> The glute kegel concept is relatively simple: clench your cheeks as hard as possible for 5–10 seconds, for several sets throughout the day. Additionally, when you’re walking, make an effort to clench the glutes as you take a stride, feeling the muscle work on either side.

> I did 3 sets of 10-second clenches multiple times throughout the day. I’d stand up from my desk, pretend to stretch and clench the cheeks extra tight. When I brushed my teeth in the morning and at night, when I walked, when I was warming up for my regular rehab movements — glute kegels constantly.

> TL:DR Squeezed my ass cheeks together throughout the day to solve longterm knee issues and make massive gains in gym.

> Several times a day, we’d stop and compress our knees and feet with Voodoo Floss — I highly recommend this for anyone doing any type of exercise ever, it’s an essential tool. I also brought a tiny ball to roll out our feet and shins, and ended up being very grateful to have it.

I have this now, and need to work on the technique for wrapping but pain temporarily goes away when doing this.
