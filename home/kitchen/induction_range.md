## Considerations

Might end up doing a notable remodel of the kitchen in 5 years or so, but in the mean time need to get away from crappy electric element. Given the cost of a nice electric element, might as well go induction. Don't want to remodel now, so 30" range it is.

### Free-standing vs Slide-in

Most induction are slide-in, especially as you move away from the cheaper models. My backsplash doesn't cover the gap between the two, since I currently have a freestanding. However, I would rather deal with backsplash issues than shitty electric range issues.

There is another problem that may come up, which is counter fit. Some slide-ins are basically free-standing styled differently, and some are designed to fit tightly and precisely with your countertops. It seems a lot of brands have a $100 coupon to modify your counter as needed to fit, but this may be an issue.

### Knobs vs touch

A common failure point is the touch controls, especially if they are placed close to cooking elements, due to moisture damaging the components. Aim for something with knobs and/or a front-facing control panel.

### Why not cooktop?

This would require a re-model of at least part of the kitchen. Will consider this when the time comes, since there's way more options with induction cooktops vs ranges.

## Models

### GE

https://products.geappliances.com/appliance/gea-category/ranges?COOKTOP+TYPE=Induction

GE is now owned by a Chinese company, and I see a consistent theme of dates design (other than maybe their cafe line) + not so good reliability. I think this brand is a pass for me.

### KitchenAid

https://www.kitchenaid.com/major-appliances/ranges/see-all.html?plp=%253Arelevance%253Acategory%253AMajorAppliancesRanges%253ARange%2520Fuel%2520Type%253AElectric%2520Induction&plpView=grid

Upscale brand for whirlpool. They only have one, with single vs dual oven option.

#### KSIB900ESS / KFID500ESS

https://www.homedepot.com/p/KitchenAid-7-1-cu-ft-Slide-In-Induction-Range-with-Self-Cleaning-Convection-Oven-in-Stainless-Steel-KSIB900ESS/205960823

Here's a negative review that highlights the bad controls (from https://www.bestbuy.com/site/reviews/kitchenaid-7-1-cu-ft-self-cleaning-slide-in-electric-induction-convection-range-stainless-steel/7500481?rating=1):

```
This is the second induction range I’ve owned, first one was made by another manufacturer. Here are the design issues I’ve encountered.
1.) The induction burners on the left side are too close together, about an inch apart. Induction works by using magnets in a very specific location to create heat. Move the pot or pan a bit off of the burner, it won’t work. I have no issue with the principal of how induction works. My issue is that when I have 4 pots on the stove to cook, the two pots on the left hand side ****always**** touch each other. These are small to medium sized pots and pans. If you buy this stove, you too will run the risk of having too little space to cook on.
2.) The stove is the boss, not me, and if you buy this model, not you either. Say some water happens to boil over. If a little amount touches the control pad just a few inches away, the entire stove top automatically turns off and starts beeping! I know that pots of water boiling over a bit is a super rare occurance (insert sarcasm), so this would likely only be an issue for about 90-95% of the people who buy this range. Similarly, if you wish to wipe off the surface a bit while cooking, the induction top will turn off....and start beeping at you. 
3.) This range has another “feature” you’ll love. If you take something out of the oven and put it (gasp) on the ceramic surface of the induction range while cooking on the induction range, it will shut off and.....drumroll please....start beeping at you. IMO, terrible design. Kitchenaid, if your induction controls cannot take a little bit of heat or water then ***move them off of the cooking surface ffs****!!!!!
4.) Beeping, so much beeping.
5.) The oven takes a very long time to preheat. Slow.
6.) The controls for this induction range are not sensitive and difficult to operate, IMO. Be prepared to press that power or off button quite hard and for several seconds to get it to work. 

I love induction ranges, I can not recommend this one. It’s the opposite of user friendly. To summarize, if you enjoy very nice looking ranges which constantly beep at you, immediately shut off if the cooktop controls are exposed to water (small amounts) or a hot dish fresh out of the oven, then this is the unit for you and your family.
```

and similar:
```
The cooktop is a pain to use the touch controls work some time and sometimes they don't I have to go out to the breaker and power down and reset it. Put anything on the top and it starts to beep at you. In the middle of cooking, it turns itself off. The oven takes forever to get up to temperature. Overall I am very very unhappy just a really bad design and overall crappy product. Skip this and get a samsung or another brand this one it horrible.
```

I see similar complaints for the freestanding version too: https://www.homedepot.com/p/KitchenAid-6-7-cu-ft-Double-Oven-Electric-Induction-Range-with-Self-Cleaning-Convection-Oven-in-Stainless-Steel-KFID500ESS/206007754

### Samsung

https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/ranges/all-ranges/s/induction/_/n-10+11+hv204+troew/

Like the rest of their appliances, have a reputation for good features but hit-or-miss quality.

#### NE58K9560WS/AA

https://www.homedepot.com/p/Samsung-5-8-cu-ft-Slide-In-Induction-Range-with-Virtual-Flame-Technology-in-Stainless-Steel-NE58K9560WS/207017989

Highlights:
1. On-sale
1. Seems like it is less likely to have fit issues
1. knobs!
1. Not so great on power-level variety
1. Doesn't have as nice pull-out tray in the oven. 
1. In general, the oven is slightly better in dual version.
1. Doesn't look like it has bridge-mode
1. Has bread proof and dehyrate mode (I don't think dehydrate has temp selection)

### LG

https://www.lg.com/us/cooking-appliances/lg-LSE4617ST-electric-range
https://www.homedepot.com/p/LG-Electronics-6-3-cu-ft-30-in-Slide-In-Electric-Smart-Range-with-ProBake-Convection-Induction-Self-Clean-Oven-in-Stainless-Steel-LSE4617ST/207032333

Same tier as samsung. In general, better reliability. Currently about $2.6k

Notes:
1. No bridge mode
1. Single fan induction
1. No touch controls on top surface!
1. Has proof mode
1. Says 53A @ 240V, need to check to make sure that's ok (my circuit is 50)
1. Has a lot of tech stuff (alexa, etc)

### Bosch

Moving into the higher end of mid-tier.

https://www.bosch-home.com/us/productslist/cooking-baking/slide-in-ranges/induction-slide-in-ranges

There's two models, the 800 (HII8055U) and benchmark (HIIP055U). The benchmark is nicer. Key differences:

1. Telescopic oven rack
1. Bridge-zone on the top (nicer than normal, 3 zones instead of two)

Control panel on the top, like a lot of these, can break: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXsVuyahTU0

HIIP055U is about $3.7k
HII8055U is about $3k

### Dacor

https://www.dacor.com/products/collections/heritage/ranges/heritage-30-induction-pro-range

Too expensive. $6k after rebates. Would only consider those price points during full remodel.

### Miele

https://www.mieleusa.com/domestic/ranges-3003.htm?mat=09810130&name=HR_1622

$7.5k

### Wolf
